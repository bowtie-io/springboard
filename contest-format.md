Springboard is not a hackathon, it's a shipathon. We want you to show up with an API, app concept, or full blown application and walk away with a working MVP. The format and rules for this inaugural competition are pretty loose (_it's a prototype!_), but are defined as follows:

## Springboard 2015 Format:

The contest takes place over two weeks with two distinct events - Kickoff and Demo Day. Participants need to complete a team registration prior to Jan 30th in order to participate. Teams (1-3 people, 30 teams max) will compete by launching their own projects on ⋈ BowTie's frontend hosting platform.

Participation is FREE, and ⋈ BowTie assumes no ownership of your project. We just want to help you get out the door. The contest is our way of getting invaluable feedback on our own MVP.

### Kick Off Day (A-100)

#### Jan 31st, 11:00a-3:00p MST - [FatPipe ABQ](http://fatpipeabq.com)

Springboard begins with an intro and shipathon with the ⋈ BowTie founders on Jan 31st from 11:00a - 3:00p at [FatPipe ABQ](http://fatpipeabq.com) [(map)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/200+Broadway+Blvd+NE,+Albuquerque,+NM+87102/@35.084701,-106.6440609,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x87220cbc7ce053b3:0x87a438e1b38abc21).

You do not need to be present to participate, but we recommend it. You can tune in via [Google Hangout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPIYfhhvUo "A-100 Live Feed") beginning at 11am MST. Students are welcome to participate. Lunch and coffee are provided (thanks to our amazing sponsors).

You should arrive with an idea, API or application in hand. Every idea is valid, but we encourage software that can take advantage of the tools offered by the ⋈ BowTie MVP (software products, social sites, web applications, tools that leverage membership, etc.).

### Demo Day

#### Feb 13th, 5:00p-7:00p MST - [FatPipe ABQ](http://fatpipeabq.com)
