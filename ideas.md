A number of fine developers may not be able to choose which of the many problems they encounter in their daily lives that they'd like to solve. For those who are having trouble selecting, we've assembled a list of candidates to add to the complexity!

If you can't think of something that you'd like to launch, here's a list of some concepts we'd personally like to see happen. Have too many ideas or something you'd like to see a team work on? [Fork the Springboard Project](https://github.com/bowtie-io/springboard) and submit a pull request!

## Social Concepts:

### Albuquerque Tech Jobs Feed

Automatically get updates when a project is available. Offers recuriters a method to fill contract jobs and developers a chance to find them.

### ABQ Meetup Directory

Is there an Albuquerque Meetup Group for this already?

Problem Solved: With the surge of the Albuquerque Tech Scene there are a tremendous number of meetup groups - it's hard to figure out which ones to attend.

The directory may be more user-centric and could tally the most popular groups and which folks tend to show up at which meetings.

### Comprehensive Park Closure Alert

Is my park open? Can I hike today?

Problem Solved: Closures are listed on various national, state and city sites, and it's often difficult to get up to date information.

A combined list of park closures for national, state and city parks would pull from existing official resources and the community to log closures of parks and trails and ensure you don't make the three hour drive to find a closed road.

### Preposterous!

Problem Solved: Following the citation trails to papers that may not be accurate makes finding papers that rely on existing claims and build on the foundations of science and research difficult.

1. Enter a hypothesis / predicate
1. Cite research that supports the hypothesis / predicate
1. Cite research that does not support the hypothesis / predicate

Create a graph of the citations. A citation has a page where the correctness of the citation acts as the hypothesis, and for which supporting and negating citations can be added. Include a sample size and date. Could make group trends in anecdotal evidence stastically worthy! ;)

Based on the related citations at various depths, the parent hypothesis or predicate can be given a validity score.

Expand to make every day observations:

- Toyotas run forever
- Jekyll is awesome
- Arnold Schwarzenegger can't Act

## Last Minute People Finder Concepts:

### Babysitter Directory

Problem Solved: Finding a local babysitter at the last minute

A babysitter may schedule a time where they'd be willing to take a child at the last minute. Connections with Facebook for reviews and trustworthiness if connected to a friend on Facebook.


### Translator Directory

Problem Solved: Finding a translator at the last minute

## Food Related Concepts:

### Community Garden Group Platform

"Oh, you're putting tomatoes in? It froze in the Sandias today... you might want to wait." - a forum for exchanging information about what's growing where and perhaps finding cooperative exchanges for the produce.

Problem solved: Microclimate planting advice and local direction for individuals in the community.

Specific features: Produce yields, plant times, community members, support groups.

Monetization: Monthly membership fee for each garden. Advertisement ;)


### Green Chile Directory

Find and rank the hottest green chile.

Problem Solved: Wouldn't you pay to find the best Green Chile for your
enchiladas?

## Financial Concepts:

### Bill Genius

Problem Solved: Folks living on thin margins have difficulty determining whether
unplanned purchases are possible.

Planning without a budget. Tallying a list of current recurring expenses and
tracking one time expenses can provide a forecast of an account balance over
time and allow a user to determine if they can purchase an item and still meet
bills that may be withdrawn at varying monthly cycles.

## Physical Services:

### Dumper

A service to aggregate a list of items that need hauled away from properties
with a bid amount and an address.

Problem Solved: That Christmas tree sitting on the front lawn in March.

Value for the customer: the ability to place an item for bid and have it hauled
away effectively.

Value for the service provider: the ability to determine a profitable route once
there are a number of bids on a particular route.

Bonus: Set up the route finder and solve P=NP (or hack your way around it)!
