&#8904; BowTie Springboard 2015 kicked off on Jan 31st at [FatPipe ABQ](http://fatpipeabq.com) [(map)](https://www.google.com/maps/place/200+Broadway+Blvd+NE,+Albuquerque,+NM+87102/@35.084701,-106.6440609,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x87220cbc7ce053b3:0x87a438e1b38abc21). **We have 24 teams competing. Woot! You are all amazing.**

## Kick Off Resources:

### Getting Started with &#8904; BowTie
A number of folks made commits in the UI before doing the suggested first steps in the dash welcome msg. Here are those steps for reference:

- Install the [BowTie-io Client](https://github.com/bowtie-io/bowtie-io):
  - `gem install bowtie-io`
  - Now you can run a local build of your project and Jekyll blog using `bowtie serve` This will output your site at [*localhost:4000*](localhost:4000/)

- Add Your SSH Key to the BowTie interface
  - github has a nice [SSH Key troubleshooting guide](https://help.github.com/categories/ssh/)
  - _*Team members should have their SSH keys added to a central team account._


- Clone Your Repo (master is default, we recommend cloning development as well)
  - SSH clone URL is on your dashboard and in your project settings


### Issue Reporting
We are tracking any/all issues for the platform on our github page for the Springboard project site:
[**Follow the Springboard Project on github**](https://github.com/bowtie-io/springboard/issues)

#### Help with our Docs!
Our docs are admittedly a bit weak right now, but under heavy revision. We put them up on github in our Springboard project if you want to contribute. Please submit pull requests.
[**BowTie docs.md on github**](https://github.com/bowtie-io/springboard/blob/master/bowtie-docs.md)


If you get hung up, just use the feedback form in your account settings. We are pretty responsive. We also set up a Slack group for support. Let me know if you want to be added via that feedback form.

### Questions
Email [help@bowtie.io](mailto:help@bowtie.io) with any/all questions. You can also request an invite to the _bowtie-support slack group_.

### Kick Off Live-stream
A live stream of the event was recorded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYPIYfhhvUo "A-100 Live Feed")**
